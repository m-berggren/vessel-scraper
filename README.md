## Populate your database with vessels from the web
A small GUI program that loads a database with some information about 5000+ container vessels. You are able to add more vessels by searching for a vessel name and the program will scrape the web for some information - or you can add it manually.

##### Can normally run through
    py main.py

##### But you can also create an exe file with this command
    pyinstaller main.py --onefile --name Vessel-Database-Executable --windowed
